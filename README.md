# Unexpected Loop Behavior with continue and increment in loop condition
This example demonstrates a subtle error involving C's `continue` statement, increment/decrement operators, and loop conditions. The code intends to print numbers 1, 2, 4, and 5, but it will print 1, 2, 4, 5, which is unexpected.  The `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration. However, the increment operation occurs *before* the next iteration starts. This means when x is 3, even though continue is called, `x++` still happens, making x become 4 before the next check occurs. This can be easily overlooked and leads to unintended loop behavior. The solution demonstrates how to correct this using a different loop structure to resolve the unexpected output.
